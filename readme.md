## About

![Vimify](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HendrikPetertje/vimify/master/example.png)

[vimify](https://github.com/Hendrikpetertje/vimify) is a plugin for [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) 
origionally inspired by [MuAnsari96](https://github.com/MuAnsari96/vimify).
It provides a simple Spotify integration within Vim to search and play music on
OSX. This version of vimify uses AppleScript to talk with spotify.
Just make sure you have Spotify running somewhere and the plugin should work.

For the search functions you will need to follow the new instructions in the setup
part of this readme. Linux support trough Dbus / some code cleaning is underway,
as well as looking for albums and artist.

## Features and Usage
vimify is designed to interface with a running desktop instance of Spotify. Currently, the following features are supported:

* `:SpPlay` will play the current track
* `:SpPause` will pause the current track
* `:SpPrevious` will move to the previous track
* `:SpNext` will move to the next track
* `:Spotify` or `:SpToggle` will toggle play/pause
* `:SpSearch <query>` will search spotify for 'query' and return the results in a new buffer. While working in the Vimify buffer, the name, artist and album of all pertinent tracks will be displayed. Vimify's behavior in this buffer is described as follows::
    * `<Enter>`: If the cursor is over the name of the track, Spotify will begin playback of that track
    * `<Enter>`: If the cursor is over the name of the artist, all of the artists tracks will be displayed, sorted chronologically and by album
    * `<Enter>`: If the cursor is over the name of the album, all of the tracks on the album will be displayed in the proper order
    * `<Space>`: Is bound to `:SpToggle` when working in the Vimify buffer

## Installation
The preferred way to install vimify is to use [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen). With pathogen installed, simply run
```bash
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/MuAnsari96/vimify
```
### update March 2018: Vimify now requires authentication.

1. Create a new spotify application at https://beta.developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications
2. Grab the Client Id and Client secret of your brand new spotify developer application
3. Go to https://www.base64encode.org/ and paste your client id and secret like `client:secret` (don't forget the colon). Example:

```
afff3bbbdffff7ebclientID452855f9:afff3bbbdffff7secretfdfd452855f9
```

4. Grab the encoded result to your clipboard and paste it in your vimrc like:

```
let g:spotify_token='YOURENCODEDRESULTHERE'
```

* It's bit of an extra step to encode it, but safes code in the plugin, plus you
won't be putting a hard-coded password in your env files (though a bas64 string is easy
to spot and more than easy to reverse!!!!).

And you'll be good to go! Once help tags are generated, you can just run `:help vimify` in vim to see the manual.

## Roadmap
- Clean up the code and break things apart to their own sections / files
- Instead of making a file that opens as an interface, 
  push the whole thing to `:copen` (need to dig in some literature for that).
- Make a setup interface that helps new users create a `Authorisation: Basic`
  token without having to read this readme or visiting shady encoding sites.
- Your ideas and wishes.
